    <title>Wifi IoT card in Monitor mode</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/wifi-iot-card-in-monitor-mode/2427</link>
    <description>Hello

Does Talon WiFi Bluetooth NFC IoT Card support monitor mode to scan WIFI clients without being connected? Do we support monitor mode? 

  Application is to detect street traffic, store visits, and people behavior around the city, parks, inside specifics spaces as museums, parks and festivals, stores, restaurants or public transport.  We  need   to detect WIFI customer MAC without connection.  We need to support WIFI in  &quot;monitor mode&quot; to detect WIFI MAC of the clients without having a connection.

<p>Monitor mode, or RFMON (Radio Frequency MONitor) mode, allows a computer with a wireless network interface controller (WNIC) to monitor all traffic received on a wireless channel. Unlike promiscuous mode, which is also used for packet sniffing, monitor mode allows packets to be captured without having to associate with an access point or ad hoc network first. Monitor mode only applies to wireless networks, while promiscuous mode can be used on both wired and wireless networks. Monitor mode is one...</p>
