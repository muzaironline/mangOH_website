    <title>Help with Audio on MangOH Green</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/help-with-audio-on-mangoh-green/9509</link>
    <description>I have a  linux application that uses ALSA for audio and am trying to get it to work on the MangOH Green.  Any help is appreciated! I found one post from 2018 with a similar issue and nothing mentioned worked.

The issue I ran into is asound isn&#39;t included in the cross compile sdk. I tried working around this by compiling my own version of library and while it built and the app loads on the board it can&#39;t open the pcm stream.  I looked at the yocto project and it includes a private precompiled version of ALSA but not the development library. 

The questions are:
1)Is there a version of the firmware and sdk that includes asound?
2)The post I found regarding alsa mentions a USB dongle for audio, is this required?
3)If alsa is not possible, is there a sample audio app to test using the legato audio framework? If need be I can port the app to that framework.</description>
