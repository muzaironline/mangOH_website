    <title>How to use this section</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/how-to-use-this-section/133</link>
    <description>As we are now seeing the community develop, we would like people to use this section to highlight the cool things that they are building with mangoh. 

So what does this mean?

This means, if you are doing something awesome with mangoh using the  hardware or  software (Legato) or cloud (AirVantage) or mechanical or 3D printing  and would like to make other aware of it, please post here. Use this section to show off, brag or whatever it takes to impress others.

cheers,
