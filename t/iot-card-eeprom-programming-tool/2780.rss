    <title>IoT Card - EEPROM Programming Tool</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/iot-card-eeprom-programming-tool/2780</link>
    <description>Hello,
I have found on your Github a tool for generating IoT card EEPROM binaries from a YAML file and i would like to know if you also have a small program to flash the binaries from a mangOH RED / LEGATO.
Thanks
Best regards,
Stephane</description>

            <p>Originally, the idea was that the EEPROM contents would be used to automatically load the appropriate drivers and configure any hardware muxing required to use the card.  That infrastucture has never really materialized.  In my opinion the EEPROM format is not sufficiently rich to be able to setup every possible variety of device.  As a result, the EEPROM contents are mostly just ignored today.  If you want to write to the eeprom of a card, you can try to cross-compile <a href="https://github.com/tat/eeprog" rel="nofollow noopener">eeprog</a> and use that to write the eeprom.  I have used that in the past.</p>
