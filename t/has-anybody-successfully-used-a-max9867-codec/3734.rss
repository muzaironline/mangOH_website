    <title>Has anybody successfully used a MAX9867 CODEC?</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/has-anybody-successfully-used-a-max9867-codec/3734</link>
    <description>I plan to use the WP module in a product, loosely based on MangOH Red. But for a number of reasons I don&#39;t want to use the Red&#39;s CODEC instead I would like to use MAX9867.

Unfortunately though we have a hole in the skill sets of our organisation when it comes to drivers &amp; kernel modules. Our software people are applications guys and I&#39;m a hardware engineer with a basic working knowledge of Linux.

I see there is driver code at https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/sound/soc/codecs/max9867.c but our s/w guys don&#39;t know if it&#39;s suitable for the mangoh/legato platform ( think the comment was that it was for a later kernel), and I can&#39;t commit to a hardware design not knowing if it will work. So I&#39;m in a bit of a catch-22 :slightly_frowning_face:

So, has anybody tried this device and got it working on either the Magngoh boards or their own device based on the WP modules? We&#39;ll be using the WP7607.

Or, is anyone willing to help and/or do the work for us on a contract basis? I have a couple of contacts for Linux engineers but they won&#39;t be familiar with the target platform so would probably take just as long getting toolchains or build environments set up than they would doing the actual work.

Thanks,</description>
