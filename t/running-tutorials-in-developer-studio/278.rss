    <title>Running tutorials in Developer Studio</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/running-tutorials-in-developer-studio/278</link>
    <description>I have successfully run the TimerLed sample under the mangOH/samples/tutorials/hardwareInterfaces/gpio/... using the terminal ([tutorial here](http://kasembeddedprojects.blogspot.ca/2016/11/the-mangoh-green-is-board-developed-by.html)). I would now like to do the same thing using the Developer Studio. My goal is to be able to better understand the file structure as well as the code. 

If I could therefore run the samples from Developer Studio that would be great. I have tried importing the projects, opening the projects, opening the files but nothing has allowed me to open the project as a whole in  Developer Studio.

Thank you in advance

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://forum.mangoh.io/u/kas.lewis">@Kas.Lewis</a>,<br>
our target is indeed to provide consistent tooling features, whatever if you’re a terminal or an IDE user.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does that mean that the Legato Applications that are compiled and can run on the mangOH board using the terminal from the samples directly can not be opened and edited using Developer Studio ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As DS needs metadata files, let’s say it needs to be “imported” in the IDE, rather than “opened”.<br>
It’s already possible with DS 4.X (use the <strong>File &gt; Import &gt; Developer Studio &gt; Import existing code as Legato Project</strong> wizard).<br>
Anyway, please be informed that we totally reworked this part in the next DS release (coming with next Legato release), and as Ashish said, we’re working on making the MangOH tutorials working from the IDE as well.<br>
You can expect this release to be available by mid-December.</p>

            <p>We are working on having the Mangoh tutorials on Dev studio. <a class="mention" href="https://forum.mangoh.io/u/daav">@daav</a> can provide more insight into the timelines.<br>
Cheers<br>
