    <title>Kernel Cold-plug USB power issues, where to start looking</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/kernel-cold-plug-usb-power-issues-where-to-start-looking/2883</link>
    <description>Hi there,

I&#39;m new to debugging USB power issues in the Kernel, so I am looking for help in
understanding the sequence of events / where to continue looking:

My board is loosely based on the mangOH green, it is using Legato for wp76xx R12,
Linux kernel 3.18.122.

My issue is that on powering up the board, 2 devices directly connected to the HSIC host,
are not enumerated. The 2 devices are Ethernet (on HSIC) and an SD card reader.

I have 2 boards: one which exhibits the issue and one that does not.

The only differences that I can see from dmesg/logread are:

    swi-mdm9x28-wp user.info kernel: [    1.141708] msm_hsic_host 7c00000.hsic_host: HSIC-USB in low power mode
    swi-mdm9x28-wp user.info kernel: [    1.141916] msm_hsic_host 7c00000.hsic_host: HSIC-USB exited from low power mode
    .
    .
    swi-mdm9x28-wp user.err kernel: [    6.530202] usb 1-1: device descriptor read/64, error -110

So with a bit of digging I see that  msm_hsic_runtime_suspend() from ehci-msm-hsic.c is being called,
bu I know of no reason why msm_hsic_runtime_suspend(0 is getting called - 
the USB controller or system should not be entering into suspend.


I suppose disabling USB sleep might help, but I still don&#39;t understand why/how it&#39;s being told to go to sleep.


Any pointers on where to look greatly received.</description>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>It looks like having EXTUIMSWITCHEN  enabled <em>was</em> the cause of the  <code>read/64, error -110</code>  error.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br>
Ian</p>

            <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>Found out 1 thing. For GPIO6/Pin46  - EXTUIMSWITCHEN was enabled instead of Reset Out.</p>
<p>With it set to Reset Out or as a  GPIO this error does not appear.</p>
<p>Now it looks like my next task is to stop the rest of the Kernel using Pin46/GPIO6 when I have it configured as a GPIO.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your post.  Please provide an update if you learn anything else.  I’m not sure what the root cause of the descriptor read failures is.</p>

            <p>OK so after some more digging :<br>
The system can put the USB into suspend/low power mode if it thinks that nothing is connected to it.  So this is possibly connected to the  <code>read/64, error -110</code> error message though as that message appears over six seconds later this still begs the question(s)<br>
“What is the initial cause ?”  -<br>
Where is the decision made to put the USB hub into low power made ?<br>
Where in the code could the issue be seen first ?</p>
<p>So far half the remedies, that I have seen,  for <code>read/64, error -110</code>  are to power down the board and disconnect the devices for a few minutes.  Not really practical where everything in connected to tracks on a board, and I don’t know why solution should work.</p>
<p>The other half center on filters, shorter cables and using powered hubs which all tally with power/voltage drop issues.</p>
<p>At the moment I am still trying to rule out software/config issues.</p>
<p>Again, any hints on where in the code to look gratefully received(and may to stop my ramblings).</p>
