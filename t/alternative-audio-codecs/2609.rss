    <title>Alternative audio CODECs?</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/alternative-audio-codecs/2609</link>
    <description>[Also posted on Sierra Wireless forum]

Hi

I was wondering what experience or advice others may have about audio CODECs for use with the WP7600-series devices? I&#39;m looking for alternatives to the WM8944 used on the mangOH boards to reduce my BoM cost... in fact I don&#39;t really need a full blown codec, just mono analog audio out will suffice for audio playback from Legato or Linux applications. I don&#39;t need voice call ability.

Obviously will need to be either supported or be able to be compiled into the Linux build.

Thanks</description>
