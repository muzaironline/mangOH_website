    <title>Lsusb not found, unable to mount usb drive</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/lsusb-not-found-unable-to-mount-usb-drive/1893</link>
    <description>On module: **mangOH Red (WP7608)**, with firmware **version 9** and **legato ver 18.03**.

Trying to insert a memory stick into the USB host port of mangOH red. It&#39;s led is blinking and dmesg shows it&#39;s connected properly without errors.

&gt; root@swi-mdm9x28:~# lsusb
&gt; -sh: lsusb: not found

Even if lsusb isn&#39;t found, the module crashes completely when I use:

&gt; root@swi-mdm9x28:~# fdisk -l
&gt; Disk /dev/mtdblock0: 2 MB, 2621440 bytes
&gt; 255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 0 cylinders
&gt; Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
&gt; 
&gt; Disk /dev/mtdblock0 doesn&#39;t contain a valid partition table

command, preventing me from even being able to mount it. I did a &quot;Erase user partition&quot; from Legato Developer Studio, did that remove some files? This is happening on all firmware versions (tested 6, 8 and 9).</description>

            <p>Thank you! Mounting USB sticks is working fine now. Your script works alright, but wanted to add native lsusb. Added <code>IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " usbutils"</code> to <code>mdm9x28-image.inc</code> (any better to place to add it?) within the yocto recipes and it successfully added the binaries. But, lsusb is still giving the below issue:</p><aside class="quote quote-modified" data-post="1" data-topic="1372">

    Hi 
I am working with a mangoh red board with a wp7502 
I am having problems with libusb, that seems to be partly working, 
If I call lsusb it will break with an "exception unable to initialize libusb: -99" but libusb -t  seems to work 
I have tried the fixes i <a href="https://forum.mangoh.io/t/usb-driver-failing-to-find-or-power-usbs/1033/17">USB driver failing to find or power USBs</a>  with no luck. 
When I try to call libusb from python it seqfaults and if i try from mono i am able to get libusbversion but as soon as try to get the device list it seqfaults. 
I also have tried t…

<p>But the package added another bin named lsusb.py, which seems to be working partly.</p>
<p>lsusb.py:</p>

            <p>I confirm the issue with “<code>fdisk -l</code>” when used without additional parameters.<br>
For USB drives, you can use “<code>fdisk -l /dev/sd*</code>” which is working fine.<br>
I can mount my USB flash drive (FAT32 filesystem) with the same setup as you by using this command:<br>
<code>mount /dev/sda1 /media/</code></p>
<p>Regarding “<code>lsusb</code>” tool, you can build a custom rootfs image with “usbutils” package by using Yocto.<br>
Or  you can use the following “poor man’s lsusb” script:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#!/bin/sh
for D in /sys/bus/usb/devices/*; do
    if [ -d "${D}" ]; then
        VID=${D}/idVendor
        PID=${D}/idProduct
        PROD=${D}/product
        BUS=${D}/busnum
        DEV=${D}/devnum
        if [ -e "$VID" ]; then
            printf "Bus %03d Device %03d: ID %s:%s" $(cat ${BUS} ${DEV} ${VID} ${PID})
            if [ -e "$PROD" ]; then
               echo " "$(cat ${PROD})
            else
               echo
            fi

            <p>I noticed that <code>fdisk -l</code> has issues. I forgot to check whether a bug has been reported for this or not. I will try to look into it tomorrow. What I do remember is that <code>fdisk -l /dev/mtdblk0</code> will work.</p>
