    <title>Old Mangoh Yellow into AirVantage</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/old-mangoh-yellow-into-airvantage/10249</link>
    <description>Hello,

I have some old (2019) mangoh yellows which we connected to Octave a century ago.
We are trying now to get back on work with them, but they do not connect to the network anymore.
Correction, they connect to the provider, but not data is exchanged as the network cannot be brought on.

AT!GSTATUS?
!GSTATUS: 
Current Time:  3911		Temperature: 41
Modem Mitigate Level: 0		ModemProc Mitigate Level: 0	
Reset Counter: 1		Mode:        ONLINE         
System mode:   GSM        	PS state:    Attached     
IMS reg state: UNKNOWN         	IMS mode:    Not Support  
IMS Srv State: UNKNOWN SMS,UNKNOWN VoIP
GSM band:      GSM900     
GSM channel:   71
GMM (PS) state:REGISTERED     	NORMAL SERVICE 
MM (CS) state: IDLE           	NORMAL SERVICE 

Serving cell:  45 (GSM900     )
RX level (dBm):-84.3125 	LAC:         032D (813)
GPRS state:    GPRS STANDBY   	Cell ID:     000048FB (18683)


I read that old yellows dis not carry 100MB free data SIMs as the Red&#39;s did.

Is there anyway to check if a certain sim has already expired? Is it possible to purchase more 100M sims from sierra to populate the yellows?

We have like 30 reds connected to airvantage and we would like to keep the same setup for or collection of yellows.

Thanks a lot,
Enric</description>
