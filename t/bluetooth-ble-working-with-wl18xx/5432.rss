    <title>Bluetooth/BLE working with WL18xx?</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/bluetooth-ble-working-with-wl18xx/5432</link>
    <description>I would be interested in hearing from anyone who has got a Bluetooth or BLE application working with the WL18xx as found on the Talon card. I have found that connect under bluetoothctl doesn&#39;t work, and info works from the non-mangOH side but not the mangOH side. Particularly what firmware version are you using. Mine is SWI9X06Y_02.35.02.00 5208b3 jenkins 2020/06/10 00:30:12.

On the other side of the coin I have been able to get a nRF UART BLE peripheral application working on the mangOH Yellow and I&#39;d be happy to give advice to anyone trying something similar.</description>
