    <title>How to take ownership of GPIO 6</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/how-to-take-ownership-of-gpio-6/2933</link>
    <description>My board is loosely based on the mangOH green, it is using Legato for wp76xx R12,
Linux kernel 3.18.122.

I want to take control of GPIO6 (Pin 46) but It looks like something else has control of it, via pinctrl.


Both  gpio_request(6, &quot;Special Reset&quot;)  and gpio_direction_output(6,1) return 0 - indicating success

but &quot;cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio&quot;  shows  &quot; gpio6   : out 2 2mA pull down&quot; with no label and the pin output is not affected.

I would have that the call to would have given me an error, though reading the documentation it could be interpreted that I only get an error for repeated calls to gpio_request() for the same gpio.

I&#39;m very new to pinctrl on this , or any other platform.  Any Ideas in my best course of action ?

Regards,
Ian</description>

            <p>Hi Lotam,</p>
<p>Yes! That worked fine, thanks.<br>
It took me a while to reply as I couldn’t confirm until I could confirm that the pin was toggled.<br>
It turns out that under Linux pinctrl hardware GPIO6 (pin 46) is accessible as GPIO 1022 via gpio_direction_output().</p>
<p>Had to try and export all possible GPIOs with <code>echo ${gpio_num} &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export</code>, list which ones were successful,  and then toggle the listed GPIOs with</p>
<pre><code>echo -e "\n\n going to toggle /sys/class/gpio/gpio${gpio_id}"
echo out &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio${gpio_id}/direction
echo 1 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio${gpio_id}/value
sleep 1

#Now toggle the 'pin'
echo 0 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio${gpio_id}/value
sleep 1
echo 1 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio${gpio_id}/value
</code></pre>
<p>And then look throught the dmesg output to see what was being done with $gpio_id, and that’s there GPIO 1022 said “Hello”.</p>
<p>Hopefully there 's a more logical way to work out the pinctrl GPIO mappings (I couldn’t see it at the time though).</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help and suggestions.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br>
Ian</p>

            <p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>Thanks for the AT response.<br>
From below, GPIO6 was configured as “4” GPIO (i.e. manage by modem).</p>

<img alt="" width="20" height="20" src="https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/i/bb73d2/40.png" class="avatar"> Ian:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>+WIOCFG: 6,4,0,0,1,0,0</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As you want to use it from Linux, please set to “16” (Embedded Host <em>GPIO available in Linux</em>) and reset:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AT+WIOCFG=6,16<br>
AT!RESET</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you could use it from Linux sysfs.</p>
<p>Please update does it work for you. Hope it helps.<br>
Thx</p>

            <p>Hi lotam,</p>
<p>Yes thanks for your suggestion, In a <a href="https://forum.mangoh.io/t/kernel-cold-plug-usb-power-issues-where-to-start-looking/2883/2">previous question here</a> I discovered that GPIO 6 had not been properly configured via the AT commands, and corrected that.</p>
<p>The root issue is having the correct control of the RESET OUT pin  (RESET_OUT_N) = Pin 46 on the chip.</p>
<p>In the <em>Linux</em> kernel pinctrl  (pinctrl-mdm9607.c) Pin46 is listed as GPIO46 so I’ve now switched over to using that, I still don’t seem to have the required control.<br>
I have seen posts for other devices where there was an offset in pinctrl so that real_world_pin_x mapps onto pinctrl_pin_y does anyone know if that is the case here ?</p>
<p>yocto/kerneldrivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-mdm9607.c doesn’t seem op imply such an offset.<br>
Is there anything that I am missing ?</p>
<p>(Can I change the title or should I start another question?  As the title is a little misleading)</p>

Ian</p>

            <p>Hi Ian</p>
<p>It maybe because GPIO6 is multi-function pin, please refer to PTS and AT cmd guide:</p>
<p><a href="https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airprime/hardware_specs_user_guides/airprime_wp76xx_product_technical_specification/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airprime/hardware_specs_user_guides/airprime_wp76xx_product_technical_specification/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airprime/software/airprime_wpx5xx_wp76xx_wp77xx_at_command_reference/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://source.sierrawireless.com/resources/airprime/software/airprime_wpx5xx_wp76xx_wp77xx_at_command_reference/</a></p>
<p>Is it possible you can use other GPIO pin?<br>
Or check function configured:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AT+WIOCFG?<br>
AT!CUSTOM?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope it helps.<br>
Thx</p>

<p>looking into /sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/ (instead of /sys/class/gpio) shows that<br>
it was the pinctrl definition itself that had ownership of GPIO6 [via spi1_cs0_active and<br>
