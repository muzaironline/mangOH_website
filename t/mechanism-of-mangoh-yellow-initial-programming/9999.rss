    <title>Mechanism of mangOH Yellow &quot;initial programming&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/mechanism-of-mangoh-yellow-initial-programming/9999</link>
    <description>A mangOH Yellow has a mechanism that enables &quot;initial programming&quot;; which the &quot;mangOH Yellow Getting Started Guide&quot; (Document No. 41113347, Rev 4) says.

I have four questions to estimate the possibility of accidentally rewriting the area for the &quot;initial programming&quot;; doing it makes &quot;initial programming&quot; impossible.

1. In the &quot;initial programming&quot;, does the CF3 Module read the default firmware in a specific memory or storage?

2. What memory or storage has the default firmware?

3. Is it possible for a mangOH Yellow user to rewrite the memory or storage which has the default firmware?
I do not intentionally rewrite the memory or storage, but due to an error in the setting of the write destination path, etc.
I think if the answer of 2 is a mask ROM, that of 3 is no, but if the answer of 2 is an eMMC, that of 3 could be yes.

4. If the answer of 3 is yes(rewritable), could you tell me how to restore that area?</description>
