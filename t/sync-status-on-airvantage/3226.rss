    <title>Sync status on airvantage</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/sync-status-on-airvantage/3226</link>
    <description>Hello

I have a question regarding the sync status on airvantage. I get a sync warning stating:

&gt; Application or firmware returned by this system is unknown from AirVantage [WP7607-1_LE,19.04.0]

I have deployed my system as a bundle but I guess this is related to the firmware name/revision/type in my apps? Can someone explain or point me to the right documentation as I have not found it.</description>
