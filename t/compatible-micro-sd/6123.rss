    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/compatible-micro-sd/6123</link>
    <description>Hi I would like to know the list of uSDs supported by mangOH Green. In particular I would like to know what is the maximum size of the uSD it supports.

I read on the other topics that there was a problem on the uSD that could be solved with release 12 at the end of 2017. Now is there any news?</description>
