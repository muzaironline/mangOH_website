    <title>Reducing power requirement</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/reducing-power-requirement/10270</link>
    <description>I am trying to design a product using the MangOH Yellow to work on minimal power.
I have managed to get it to run at 7 to 30mA (@5v) with the radio active and connected. It has bursts of higher current when it is transferring data. This was achieved by pulling GPIO41 low.
With the radio off (cm radio off) and mainly in sleep mode, it still draws 7mA.
Is there any way to reduce the current further (without taking a soldering iron to the board)?
ULPM seems to require a reset and hence is not useful in our application.</description>

    Hi Paul, 
One big way to reduce power is to put the HSIC interface into suspend mode. This can drop power by 60 ma. 
–&gt; echo 0 &gt; /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1/authorized 
Also make sure wakelock is set in case USB cable is removed: 
–&gt; echo NO_SLEEP &gt; /sys/power/wake_lock 
Also, if you are ready to take a soldering iron, you can get some more improvements: 
a. Add R306 (0R), and check that  EXT_GPS_LNA_EN signal is set 0. Should be 4ma saving 
b. Savings over LEDs: 
–&gt; echo ‘AT!LEDTEST=0,1;!LEDTEST=…
