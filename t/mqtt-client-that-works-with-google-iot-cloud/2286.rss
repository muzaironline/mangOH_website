    <title>MQTT client that works with Google IOT cloud</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/mqtt-client-that-works-with-google-iot-cloud/2286</link>
    <description>Hello

We are today using paho and this MQTT wrapper: https://github.com/mangOH/MqttClient/tree/use_paho_linux_version  developed by @dfrey and others to connect to our own mosquitto broker with TLS encryption. 

But I&#39;m now trying to connect to google&#39;s mqtt bridge with TLS and JWT. But I get a socket error when trying to connect. Not sure how to investigate this further but I think this may be a clue?

Is there a known issue connecting to gcloud with sierra (WP85) and this wrapper or have someone made it work?</description>

            <p>If you use the same certificate on all clients this will work but if you want to have a uniqe certificate then maybe you could use the config tree to store the certificate?</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="https://forum.mangoh.io/u/nilsarve">@nilsarve</a> Thank you for the example.  I feel I’m still missing something on my part.  Isn’t the certificates file device specific?  If so how do you do produce units if the the certificates file is part of the build?</p>

            <p>If just bundle the certificates with my app and that works great for me.</p>
<pre><code>bundles:

            <p>Yes both solutions use TLS but google uses a long topic name but on top of that I have measured 403 bytes of overhead on every publish while I have measured this to 225 bytes on every publish to my mosquitto broker.</p>
<p>Might not sound like much but if you publish like every other minute every day 24/7 then you have alot of data. If you send big payloads but not so often it might not be a big issue.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="https://forum.mangoh.io/u/nilsarve">@nilsarve</a>,<br>
I found the issue (side effect of memory optimization). It has been fixed, please retrieve the new mqttGeneric.h file and recompile all components.<br>
Let me know if this solves your connection issue.<br>
Thanks</p>

<p>Thank you for reporting the typo (2048 instead of 2018) for the key generation.</p>
<p>Your device passed the SSL authentication steps, however for some reason the server rejects your mqtt connection request. Could you check these points :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>is the device communication has been allowed ?<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>have you uploaded the public key certificate to Google IoT Core ? And have the app to selected the private key?</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>We are today using paho and this MQTT wrapper: <a href="https://github.com/mangOH/MqttClient/tree/use_paho_linux_version" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/mangOH/MqttClient/tree/use_paho_linux_version</a>  developed by <a class="mention" href="https://forum.mangoh.io/u/dfrey">@dfrey</a> and others to connect to our own mosquitto broker with TLS encryption.</p>
<p>But I’m now trying to connect to google’s mqtt bridge with TLS and JWT. But I get a socket error when trying to connect. Not sure how to investigate this further but I think this may be a clue?<br>

<p>Is there a known issue connecting to gcloud with sierra (WP85) and this wrapper or have someone made it work?</p>
