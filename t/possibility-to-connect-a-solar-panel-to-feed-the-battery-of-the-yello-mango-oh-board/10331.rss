            <p>if I use the Lipo battery, it would come from this one.</p>
<p>If I use the solar panel directly, then from the solar panel.</p>

            <p>I am powering yes, but it is for a further moment. it would have a lipo battery 3.7 V and 650mhA. The solar panel would be for charging the battery.</p>
<p>Another option is to use the solar panel to power the board directly with a voltage converter.</p>
