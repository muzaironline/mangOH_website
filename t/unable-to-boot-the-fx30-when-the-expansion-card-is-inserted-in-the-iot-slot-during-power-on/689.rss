    <title>Unable to boot the FX30 when the expansion card is inserted in the IoT slot during power-on</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/unable-to-boot-the-fx30-when-the-expansion-card-is-inserted-in-the-iot-slot-during-power-on/689</link>
    <description>I&#39;m unable to boot the FX30 when the card is inserted in the IoT slot during power-on. If the card is not present during power-on, the FX30 will boot. I am also able to boot if I hold the SDA line to the EEPROM (Microchip 24AA32A ) low (shorted to GND) during power-on.

The IoT card has an I2C EEPROM on board, and the memory is as described in table 5-2 in [1]. We&#39;ve also tried with empty EEPROM (0xFF) and zeroed EEPROM (0x00) - the behaviour is the same. The electrical connections are also as descibed in [1], including the transistor address selector in figure 5-2.

After boot, I can hot-plug the card, and all is working perfectly. I can even access the EEPROM using i2cset, i2cget and i2cdump commands from bash.

When measuring the I2C bus with oscilloscope during power-on, I see that 64 bytes are read after about 1 second (long before linux is booted), and the speed is 400 KHz. This is not according to [1], that states that connected EEPROMs must support 100KHz.

When the boot fails, the USB is enumerated as &quot;Qualcomm HS-USB QDLoader 9008 (COM183)&quot;, which to me may indicate that this is something that happens pre-image-boot.

Does anyone know anything about this? Are there others with the same experience or who is using EEPROM successfully?
