    <title>Can&#39;t find any yellow mangOH in stock to buy</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/cant-find-any-yellow-mangoh-in-stock-to-buy/4388</link>
    <description>Does anybody have issues when purchasing a yello mangOH Basic card? did you have any issues with the backorder? 

Or do you have a vendor that may have some in stock? as the ones I have checked, the lead time is more than 2months.</description>

            <p>Hey Scott,</p>
<p>I’m not sure of your connection with Sierra Wireless, but would you happen to have an status on the mangOH Yellow cards availability? I can’t find any way of contacting them. I’m buying through Digi-Key, and they don’t know either.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex.</p>

            <p>All other models of mangOH Yellow were due to ship about a month ago then the factory was shut down due to Covid. They are carefully coming back to work and we anticipate shipping in 2-4 weeks.</p>
