    <title>WP7702 with LTE-enabled SIM issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/wp7702-with-lte-enabled-sim-issues/2616</link>
    <description>Hi

When I use WP7702 with an LTE and GSM-enabled SIM but *not* LTE-M1/LTE-NB enabled, the WP module does not use the GSM fallback. And even if I get it to use the GSM fallback it does not maintain a stable connection.

The only way for me to get a stable connection is by disabling LTE RAT completely using `at+ksrat=1`.

Is this a known issue, any known workarounds or fixes that doesn&#39;t involve completely disabling LTE?</description>
