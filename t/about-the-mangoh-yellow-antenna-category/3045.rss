            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/auroraandujar/" rel="nofollow noopener">Aurora Andújar</a> and I have been working with Virtual Antenna™ technology for the last 12 years. I would like to help you as much as possible with the antenna integration inside your MangOH Yellow based project. My first recommendation is starting your design with the antenna. If you start by embedding the antenna you can easily optimize the antenna performance to achieve the best possible efficiency. Selecting the right placing of the antenna on the board and also the surrounding components will help in optimizing the coverage of your IoT device.</p>
<p>I am here to start whenever you feel like. Please post your questions here!</p>
