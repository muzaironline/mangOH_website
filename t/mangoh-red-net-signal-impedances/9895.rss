    <title>MangOH Red - Net Signal Impedances</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/mangoh-red-net-signal-impedances/9895</link>
    <description>Hello,

I wanted to ask about the Layer Impedance table that comes with Mangoh red Gerber files (File attached). Do we have a list of signal nets using these impedance profiles?

I saw there was already this question but I have an urgent project and wanted to see if I could get a quicker answer. If there is a number we could instead utilize to ask about this, we would be very grateful.

Thank you!
