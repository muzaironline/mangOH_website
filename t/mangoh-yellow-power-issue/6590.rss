    <title>MangOH Yellow Power Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.mangoh.io/t/mangoh-yellow-power-issue/6590</link>
    <description>Issue : Power cycling Yellow board will cause the system to &quot;lock-up&quot; and requires pressing the reset button to allow the system to restart. 

Reproduction steps : Plug USB or Expansion power in(Pin 1 &amp; 15), switch on, powers up fine. Disconnect power and reinsert USB or Expansion power in any time from 1s to 15s, reapply power and the board will not boot. Cycling the power switch does nothing. Pressing the reset button will restart the board and comes up. 

Looking at the schematics, it appears the power does go through the BQ25601 and is causing this issue. I do not have a battery connected. 

Functionality : Apply 5V on, disconnect 5V, turns off. 

Thanks,
Curtis</description>

            <p>I am seeing this as well. After power cycling the mangOH yellow, I have to also press the RESET button briefly to get it to actually boot up and become accessible over SSH.</p>
<p>I would much rather it just boot on power up.</p>
<p>mangOH Yellow with WP7611, wired and jumpered as shown:</p>

            <p>I can agree that I see this. We have a modem connected to a desktop and access it remotely. When the computer locks up and we are forced to power it down forcefully and immediately start it, the modem never comes up with it. We have to physically press the reset button. Is this by design?</p>
